Helpful (bash) scripts I wrote to make my life easier.  

`auto_backup.sh` automatically copies over predefined folders and files to a connected but not mounted external drive. It can exclude directories and ignore files larger than a max size. Uses rsync.  

`auto_backup_phone.sh` does the same but for a connected android phone, copying data from the phone to an external drive.  

`clean_directory_files.sh` cleans up ... directory files. This turns downloaded files which might have the format "something [HD][1080p] HVec...." into cleaner and nicer file and directory names.
